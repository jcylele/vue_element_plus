## About This
- Just for practice, use [vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) and [element-plus](https://element-plus.org/en-US/) to create a frontend web page for presentation and manipulation.
- The backend project(also the scrawler project) can be found here [here](https://github.com/jcylele/python-crawler)
